                            however I believe Buddhists have lost the way of the Buddha and lack a real basis of impact.
                            Effective Buddhism is a solution to those who seek to follow the Buddhist Path as Buddha
                            Wanted.

                        but lack real ACTION or PURPOSE behind this because of a misinterpretation of Dharma.

                    <p>If you go searching, there are many other ways these four vows are written, but they are all
                        telling
                        the same thing, in this order. </p>

                    <p>As anyone may observe from the outside, the most influential people in the world today are not
                        Buddhists. On top of that anyone from a Non-Buddhist city, will tell you that they have not
                        heard
                        from a Buddhist about why that path is best. </p>

                    <p> It is a sickness is the Buddha communities today to ignore the first vow, and try to move on to
                        2,3,
                        and 4. By the very means of the vows, step 2 cannot be done without first completing step 1.
                        Step 1
                        is in fact, an earthly desire. The Four Main Vows are a harmonious right of passage that must be
                        balanced in action towards their completion.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, the way of the Buddha should be to renounce all worldly desires IN ORDER TO save all
                        people, and to learn all teachings IN ORDER TO save all people, and that once these steps are
                        completed perfect enlightenment will be attained. This means that these tasks are in harmony. As
                        one
                        renounces more wordy desires to spend more time saving people, one learns teachings to improve
                        how
                        they go about saving others, and rides the collective path towards enlightenment.</p>

                    <p>However, instead of following this path and order, Buddhists today are known as people
                        continually
                        meditating. Struggling to awaken and renounce all worldly desires, and instead all acting to
                        each
                        other like they are farther along the path. I believe Buddhism has become a sick game of
                        ineffective
                        spiritual ego stroking.</p>

                    <p>I am not saying that the Men and Women who have become great at meditating for hours and wholly
                        living a minimalist life have not gone further down their path of enlightenment, instead that it
                        is
                        very sad that so much potential is moving towards the wrong place for the world to awaken and be
                        saved. It is a fact these people who realize their potential to follow the first vow will be
                        some of
                        the strongest Buddhas there are. </p>

                    <p>The funny thing about tech entrepreneurs who are rapidly changing the future, and Buddhism is
                        that
                        these tech entrepreneurs are slowly learning the way of the Buddha in order to optimize
                        themselves.
                        They are reaching new paths of enlightenment. Instead of referring to their actions as the
                        Buddha
                        way, they are learning the teachings of Buddha in order to be more effective.</p>

                    <p>The Longer Form Versions Of These 10 Precepts<br>
                        <strong>1.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha shall not himself kill, encourage others to kill,
                        kill
                        by expedient means,
                        praise killing, rejoice at witnessing killing, or kill through incantation or deviant mantras.
                        He
                        must
                        not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of killing, and shall not intentionally
                        kill
                        any
                        living creature. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to nurture a mind of compassion and [filial
                        piety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety_in_Buddhism), always devising expedient means
                        to
                        rescue and protect all beings. If instead, he fails to restrain himself and kills sentient
                        beings
                        without mercy, he commits a Parajika (major) offense.<br>
                        <strong>2.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha must not himself steal or encourage others to
                        steal,
                        steal by expedient
                        means, steal by means of incantation or deviant mantras. He should not create the causes,
                        conditions,
                        methods, or karma of stealing. No valuables or possessions, even those belonging to ghosts and
                        spirits
                        or thieves and robbers, be they as small as a needle or blade of grass, may be stolen. As a
                        Buddha's
                        disciple, he ought to have a mind of mercy, compassion, and filial piety -- always helping
                        people
                        earn
                        merits and achieve happiness. If instead, he steals the possessions of others, he commits a
                        Parajika
                        offense.<br>
                        <strong>3.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha must not engage in licentious acts or encourage
                        others
                        to do so. [As a monk]
                        he should not have sexual relations with any female -- be she a human, animal, deity or spirit
                        --
                        nor
                        create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of such misconduct. Indeed, he must not engage
                        in
                        improper sexual conduct with anyone. A Buddha's disciple ought to have a mind of filial piety --
                        rescuing all sentient beings and instructing them in the Dharma of purity and chastity. If
                        instead,
                        he
                        lacks compassion and encourages others to engage in sexual relations promiscuously, including
                        with
                        animals and even their mothers, daughters, sisters, or other close relatives, he commits a
                        Parajika
                        offense.<br>
                        <strong>4.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha must not himself use false words and speech, or
                        encourage others to lie or
                        lie by expedient means. He should not involve himself in the causes, conditions, methods, or
                        karma
                        of
                        lying, saying that he has seen what he has not seen or vice versa, or lying implicitly through
                        physical
                        or mental means. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to maintain Right Speech and Right Views
                        always,
                        and
                        lead all others to maintain them as well. If instead, he causes wrong speech, wrong views or
                        evil
                        karma
                        in others, he commits a Parajika offense.<br>
                        <strong>5.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha must not trade in alcoholic beverages or encourage
                        others to do so. He
                        should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of selling any intoxicant
                        whatsoever,
                        for
                        intoxicants are the causes and conditions of all kinds of offenses. As a Buddha's disciple, he
                        ought
                        to
                        help all sentient beings achieve clear wisdom. If instead, he causes them to have upside-down,
                        topsy-turvy thinking, he commits a Parajika offense.<br>
                        <strong>6.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha must not himself broadcast the misdeeds or
                        infractions
                        of
                        Bodhisattva-clerics or Bodhisattva-laypersons, or of [ordinary] monks and nuns -- nor encourage
                        others
                        to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of discussing the
                        offenses of
                        the
                        assembly. As a Buddha's disciple, whenever he hears evil persons, externalists or followers of
                        the
                        Two
                        Vehicles speak of practices contrary to the Dharma or contrary to the precepts within the
                        Buddhist
                        community, he should instruct them with a compassionate mind and lead them to develop wholesome
                        faith in
                        the Mahayana. If instead, he discusses the faults and misdeeds that occur within the assembly,
                        he
                        commits a Parajika offense.<br>
                        <strong>7.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha shall not praise himself and speak ill of others,
                        or
                        encourage others to do
                        so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of praising himself and
                        disparaging
                        others. As a disciple of the Buddha, he should be willing to stand in for all sentient beings
                        and
                        endure
                        humiliation and slander -- accepting blame and letting sentient beings have all the glory. If
                        instead,
                        he displays his own virtues and conceals the good points of others, thus causing them to suffer
                        slander,
                        he commits a Parajika offense.<br>
                        <strong>8.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha must not be stingy or encourage others to be
                        stingy. He
                        should not create
                        the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of stinginess. As a Bodhisattva, whenever a destitute
                        person
                        comes for help, he should give that person what he needs. If instead, out of anger and
                        resentment,
                        he
                        denies all assistance -- refusing to help with even a penny, a needle, a blade of grass, even a
                        single
                        sentence or verse or a phrase of Dharma, but instead scolds and abuses that person -- he commits
                        a
                        Parajika offense.<br>
                        <strong>9.</strong> A disciple of the Buddha shall not harbor anger or encourage others to be
                        angry.
                        He should not create
                        the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of anger. As a disciple of the Buddha, he ought to be
                        compassionate and filial, helping all sentient beings develop the good roots of non-contention.
                        If
                        instead, he insults and abuses sentient beings, or even transformation beings [such as deities
                        and
                        spirits], with harsh words, hitting them with his fists or feet, or attacking them with a knife
                        or
                        club
                        -- or harbors grudges even when the victim confesses his mistakes and humbly seeks forgiveness
                        in a
                        soft, conciliatory voice -- the disciple commits a Parajika offense.<br>
                        <strong>10.</strong> A Buddha's disciple shall not himself speak ill of the Triple Jewel or
                        encourage others to do so. He
                        must not create the causes, conditions, methods or karma of slander. If a disciple hears but a
                        single
                        word of slander against the Buddha from externalists or evil beings, he experiences a pain
                        similar
                        to
                        that of three hundred spears piercing his heart. How then could he possibly slander the Triple
                        Jewel
                        himself? Hence, if a disciple lacks faith and filial piety towards the Triple Jewel, and even
                        assists
                        evil persons or those of aberrant views to slander the Triple Jewel, he commits a Parajika
                        offense.

                    <h1>Reiterating The Message:</h1>
                    <p>Many buddhists today practice the seeking of enlightenment rather than practicing the way of
                        Buddha
                        himself. Buddha was an enlightened being who spread his philosophy far and wide,
                        preaching and changing and influencing the world and his actions live on to this day.</p>
                    <p>Buddhists in most countries are seen as people who simply meditate. The idea is to relinquish
                        attachment to earthly desires in order to DO MORE. Not to meditate all day to do nothing. In an
                        effort of learning all teachings, we will re-evaluate the core values, and give a new
                        perspective
                        based on the teachings. The core re-evaluation leads us to the idea that Nirvana is something to
                        achieve in this realm.
                        And that leaving this realm is a negative desire in it of itself.</p>
                </div>

                    <img src="./Images/pic5.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Let’s break them down.
                        <br>
                        <strong>1.</strong> To save all people: this is by far the biggest vow that is failed to be
                        recognized by modern
                        Buddhist society. Outreach is a non-factor. So many people who need this valuable information
                        are left in the dark, with no outreach from Buddhists. Actual progress using technology (tools
                        to increase impact) are completely disregarded.<br>
                        <strong>2.</strong> Many people have regarded this initial vow as meaning to renounce. But
                        here’s
                        what the true
                        text says “<strong>Desires</strong> for tangible things (such as wealth, property, or other
                        material goods)
                        or for pleasures of the body (such as sexual activity, gluttony, or other hedonistic pursuits).
                        Buddhism teaches us to try to let go of our <strong>worldly desires</strong>, freeing our minds
                        and bodies
                        for a state of enlightenment.”As it says, freeing our minds and bodies for a state of
                        enlightenment.<br>
                        <strong>3.</strong> Learning all teachings requires knowing all things, we do not even know how
                        consciousness
                        works yet. To learn all teachings, we need to learn by the act of doing. There is no better
                        thing to learn at this time, than how to spread change like Buddha did.<br>
                        <strong>4.</strong> “In <strong>Buddhism</strong>, <strong>enlightenment</strong> (called bodhi
                        in
                        Indian <strong>Buddhism</strong>, or satori in Zen
                        <strong>Buddhism</strong>) is when a <strong>Buddhist</strong> finds the truth about life and
                        stops
                        being reborn because
                        they have reached Nirvana.” In order to stop the cycle of rebirth, we must stop the death to
                        life cycle. With infinite time our particles are always brought back to a conscious form. Until
                        we find a conscious form to reach Nirvana in, we will repeat the cycle. “
                        <strong>Rebirth</strong>
                        in
                        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"> Buddhism</a> refers to its teaching that the
                        actions of
                        a person lead to a new existence after death,
                        in an endless cycle called
                        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra">saṃsāra</a>.[1][2] This cycle is
                        considered to be <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">duhkha</a>, unsatisfactory and
                        painful.
                        The cycle stops only if [liberation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha) is achieved by
                        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_in_Buddhism">insight</a> and the <a
